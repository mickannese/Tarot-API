There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Welcome to the Tarot API ##
  > A NodeJS based API designed to provide a backend for tarot readings that can be used for various front end applications

## Who is this for? ##
  > The front end experience will provide on-demand Tarot readings as well as educational information for those who are looking to better understand the Tarot. The API itself stands as a huge and accessible resource for independent artists who wish to expand their audience and increate the amount of interaction that they have with their community.

## Summary ##
  > The Tarot API will be used to seamlessly introduce the Tarot into various web interfaces, such as its own front-end interactive experience, a twitter account that can be called upon to recieve readings on twitter, a discord bot that can give readings in-line and other various uses. As this project develops, Independent Tarot deck creators will be able to collaborate with this project by working together with our team to create a custom endpoint to include their imagery and interpretations.

## On the current availability of Tarot on the internet ##
  > There are many places online that can provide Tarot readings, but Tarot deck creators have little resources to make their work easily available for their audience to interact with.

## Bringing artists and Tarot fans together ##
  > This project intends to eventually create endpoints as well as repeatable templates that will provide the resources necessary for Tarot deck creators to bring their work to a greater audience. It will create a central platform for users to view their artwork as well as receive readings that contain the words and interpretations directly related to the deck. This will provide a better experience for both creators and users as well as provide further opportunities for artists to share and possibly sell their work.

## A message from the Tarot API team ##
  > We seek to lighten the amount of work that artists need to put in order to showcase their work to their audience as well as create a more robust community around Tarot, divination, and spirituality as a whole.

## How to Get Started ##
  > If you are an artist that would like to get started with adding your deck to the Tarot API, reach out to us @minitarot on twitter, or send an email directly to mickannese@gmail.com with the subject line "Tarot API - Artist Application". We will send you a private form to get started adding your data to our database.

## Customer Quote ##
  > I tried many times before to try to add my deck to my website and had nearly given up because it just didnt look right. Adding my deck to the Tarot API helped me get my vision out to the world and the team was able to walk me through the process within a few hours. - Artist

  > I was able to add my tarot deck to my discord server so that my community could use it right from the general chat. Everyone has been really enjoying being able to see my art and read through the readings and some have helped me change the way that I explain certain concepts. -Artist
